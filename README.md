# word-in-binary
THis code was programmed for translating words into the binary 0/1 default.
It's pretty simple:
- lowercase letters (a - z) get the numbers 1 - 26
- uppercase letters (A - Z) get the numbers 27 - 52
Finally, the "Letter Number" will be translated into binary and printed out with spaces between the single letters and double-space between words.
In need help for the special characters, e.g. !"§$%&/()=?`´°^;,:.-_<>|
110001 1 1110 10100  10100 1111  1000 101 1100 10000?
